Description:
This program was used for two studies:
The fMRI network visualization study and the later added study on the impact of background color.

commandline parameters
GraphView [trial_index] [participant_index] [mode: 0 is formal study, else is training]

1. The fMRI network visualization study
The study researches on the performance impact on using nine types of visual marks and three positioning methods.
The data loaded to the program consists of two major parts:
a) The network matrices, which are located in \data\NBS1.2\SchizophreniaExample. The matrices folder contains 27 subject matrices and a mean matrix (averaged from all other 27 matrices). 
The folder also contains other related information such as the node names and node positions etc.
b) The task config files, which are located in data\task_configs_*. The specific folders being selected for experiment use can be changed in taskTest.cpp. 
All the config files are generated by a program compiled from taskGen.cpp

2. The color study
This is supposed to be the pilot study for the fMRI study to test whether or not different background colors have an impact on task performance.
The program data is of the same structure as that of the fMRI network study. The only difference is that each config file has an additional entry specifying the type of background color.

Controls:
Esc: quit
n or N key: next trial
You can change the variable "blinkTime" in taskTest.cpp or taskTest_fMRI.cpp to modify the crosshair blinking time (in seconds). This is useful to quikly navigate the views by setting it to 0.

Build:
All the *.cpp files with main functions are used for test purposes. Therefore, only one of those files should be included in your project to compile the corresponding executable.
The taskTest.cpp should be used for compiling the programs used for both studies. Change the task folders specfied in this cpp file to switch between the two studies. 
Task folders with "dualbackground" in their names are for the color study.
taskTest.cpp is used for the background pilot study.
taskTest_fMRI.cpp is used for fMRI study.
